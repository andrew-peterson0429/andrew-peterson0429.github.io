            <h1>Phones New to the Market</h1>

            <h3>Google Pixel 6</h3>
            <figure class="right">
                <img src="/DGM2740/11_Tech_Watch/images/pixel6.jpg" alt="pixel 6">
            </figure>
            <p>The Pixel 6 exemplifies the best of what Google services and Android 12 have to offer. So much so 
                that I'd claim that the Pixel 6 is the most significant phone upgrade Google has made since it 
                launched the Pixel line in 2016. The phone's new cameras, Google's Tensor chip and premium 
                ambitions follow months of hype -- partly stemming from Google announcing the phone months 
                before it was released -- and its bold two-tone design. All of these changes come while keeping 
                the Pixel 6 at a midtier $599 price, which easily washes away the bad taste left by the 
                understated Pixel 5. 
            </p>

            <h3>Oneplus 9 Pro</h3>
            <figure class="left">
                <img src="/DGM2740/11_Tech_Watch/images/oneplus9pro.jpg" alt="oneplus 9 pro">
            </figure>
            <p> The OnePlus 9 Pro is a legitimate flagship phone that is genuinely competitive with the best 
                Android phones on the market — at least from a features and quality perspective. Yet in terms of 
                market and mind share, it’s still destined to be a niche device for a small group of enthusiasts 
                looking for a specific kind of elegance in their Android device. What I can’t help but notice is 
                how far OnePlus has come in build quality. The glass on the front and back curves into the 
                aluminum rail on the edges with no seams at all. It’s well-balanced, beautiful, and solid. The 
                OnePlus 9 Pro offers phenomenal performance, a vastly superior camera to the brand’s previous 
                smartphones, and a variety of top-end features that make this a serious contender for anyone 
                who’s in the market for a premium Android handset. It won’t be for everyone though as the price 
                is high for this smartphone.
            </p>

            <h3>iPhone 13 Pro Max</h3>
            <figure class="right">
                <img src="/DGM2740/11_Tech_Watch/images/iphonePro13.jpg" alt="iphone 13 pro max">
            </figure>
            <p> If you’re after the best iPhone Apple has ever made by a long way, then the iPhone 13 Pro Max is it 
                - mostly down to having a genuinely long-lasting battery. You’ll need deep pockets, both literally 
                and figuratively, to own this phone, as it’s big and rather expensive - but you’re getting a decent 
                amount for your money. Some upgrades seem pretty minor - we struggled to get a lot from the new 
                120Hz ProMotion display and Cinematic mode will get quickly forgotten - but the low light camera is 
                excellent, the power onboard outstrips any phone on the market for heavy tasks and it’s bound 
                together by a cohesive user interface and app experience. If you want a big iPhone that you’ll enjoy 
                for years, this is it.
            </p>
