        Web Design and Developer in Utah
      </p>
      <div class="about-me-body">
        <p>
          My name is Andrew Peterson, I am currently in the Utah Valley area. I
          love traveling, meeting new people, and exploring the world. I have a
          passion for all things web and technology related. This led me to
          pursue a degree in something technology related and now I am a recent
          Web Design and Development graduate from Utah Valley University
          looking to put my skills to the test and expand them.
        </p>
        <p>
          My interest in technology started when I was very young. My family
          always enjoyed getting electronic gadgets and computers to tinker and
          play with. My brothers and I would always get used computer components
          and put them together in our own personal builds. Years later, I am
          continuing this tradition and building computers, but this time, I am
          not only putting components together, but I am also writing the
          software that can be used on them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though I always had a fascination with technology, I also enjoyed
          teaching. Before being a web developer, I was an English Teacher for
          second language learners. I really enjoyed my experiences teaching,
          but after teaching around Asia for a few years, I met multiple
          individuals that were working while they traveled. They were software
          engineers and web developers. This sparked my interest to further
          develop my passion for technology into a career. Leading me to Utah
          Valley Universityâ€™s Web Design and Development program. This program
          fit me perfectly. I learned about web design and its principles,
          development languages, frameworks, and libraries. I emphasized in the
          development side, because I believe being a full-stack developer is
          much more marketable than one focused on front-end.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I am working as a level 1 software engineer continuing to
          further develop my skills in hopes to one day become a senior engineer
          and create amazing applications and experiences for users and
          customers. I look forward to what the future has in store for me and
          for what exciting technologies will come.
